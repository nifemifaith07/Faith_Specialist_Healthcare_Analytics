# **Optimizing Hospital Outcomes: A Healthcare Analytics Case Study**

## **Project Overview**
This project leveraged patient data from Faith Specialist Hospital to identify key trends in discharge behavior, chronic illnesses, and clinical performance. The ultimate goal was to deliver actionable insights and recommandations to enhance patient care and operational decision-making.


## **Problem Statement**
Faith Specialist Hospital faced rising rates of Discharge Against Medical Advice (DAMA), increasing chronic disease cases, and elevated mortality in certain patient groups. Although the hospital maintained extensive records, these datasets were under-utilized in guiding clinical and management strategies.

## **Objectives**
- Analyze patient demographics in relation to hospital outcomes
- Identify primary reasons for DAMA and their impact on mortality
- Examine prevalence and outcomes of chronic illnesses
- Assess the effect of lifestyle risk factors on patient outcomes
- Evaluate doctor performance based on outcomes, specialization, and workload

## **Data Summary**
- Patients: demographic attributes (age, gender, location)
- Admissions: visit details, discharge status (DAMA vs. completed vs. deceased), DAMA reasons, chronic disease flags
- Doctors: specialization, assigned patient loads
- Risk Factors: patient history of alcohol, tobacco, NSAIDs, etc.

## **Tools & Technologies**
- Microsoft Excel: data cleaning and preliminary manipulation
- SQL: database creation, table relationships, advanced querying
- Tableau: interactive dashboards and visual presentations

## **Methodology**
- Data Cleaning (Excel): removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized text
- Database Setup (SQL): imported cleaned tables; established keys; ran analytical queries
- Visualization (Tableau): built dashboards to explore DAMA patterns, chronic illness prevalence, lifestyle impacts, and doctor performance
- Interpretation: synthesized visual outputs into insights and recommendations

## **Insights**
- DAMA: Financial constraints were the top reason; “Doctors’ strike” had the highest mortality rate despite low frequency.
- Chronic Illness: CKD and stroke were most prevalent; cancer had the highest mortality proportion.
- Lifestyle Factors: Alcohol use drove the highest DAMA rate (26%); NSAID misuse associated with both 17% DAMA and mortality.
- Doctor Performance: Overloaded doctors correlated with higher DAMA and mortality; specialized teams saw better outcomes.

## **Recommendations**
- Establish financial support programs (counseling + subsidized insurance) to reduce DAMA
- Implement chronic disease monitoring with early diagnosis & patient education
- Launch behavioral interventions for alcohol, tobacco, and NSAID misuse
- Balance doctor workloads and recognize high-performing departments
- Invest in centralized analytics dashboards for ongoing performance tracking

## **Limitations**
- Lack of longitudinal follow-up data beyond initial discharge
- Potential under-reporting in self-declared lifestyle factors
- No direct measures of patient satisfaction beyond DAMA

## **Improvements**
-Integrate financial status and follow-up data into future analyses
- Expand the analysis to track long-term patient outcomes post-discharge
- Develop predictive models for early identification of high-risk patients

## **Reflections & Learning**
Through this project, I strengthened my end-to-end analytics skills—cleaning complex datasets in Excel, structuring relational data in SQL, and translating query outputs into compelling Tableau visualizations. More importantly, I experienced firsthand how data can drive meaningful improvements in healthcare delivery.
